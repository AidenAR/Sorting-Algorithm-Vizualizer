# Sorting-Algorithm-Vizualizer
An interactive Visualizer, created in Python for several Sorting Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Selection Sort
5. Quick Sort


I do intend to improve the user interface in the coming weeks and add a few more sorting algorithms into the mix
